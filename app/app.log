This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'buffer' in '/Users/rykahsay/projects/glygen/app/node_modules/react-html-parser/node_modules/htmlparser2/lib'
BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "buffer": require.resolve("buffer/") }'
	- install 'buffer'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "buffer": false }

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'buffer' in '/Users/rykahsay/projects/glygen/app/node_modules/react-html-parser/node_modules/htmlparser2/lib'
BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "buffer": require.resolve("buffer/") }'
	- install 'buffer'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "buffer": false }

This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'buffer' in '/Users/rykahsay/projects/glygen/app/node_modules/react-html-parser/node_modules/htmlparser2/lib'
BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "buffer": require.resolve("buffer/") }'
	- install 'buffer'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "buffer": require.resolve("buffer/") }'
	- install 'buffer'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:

This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'buffer' in '/Users/rykahsay/projects/glygen/app/node_modules/htmlparser2/lib'

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "buffer": require.resolve("buffer/") }'
	- install 'buffer'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "buffer": false }

This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:

	- install 'buffer'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:

	- install 'buffer'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:

Failed to compile.

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'buffer' in '/Users/rykahsay/projects/glygen/app/node_modules/react-html-parser/node_modules/htmlparser2/lib'
BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "buffer": require.resolve("buffer/") }'
	- install 'buffer'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "buffer": false }

Something is already running on port 3000.
The build failed because the process exited too early. This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called `kill -9` on the process.
